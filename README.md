# UKEVDashboard
This Dasboard created in Dash provides an overview of EV Registrations and EV Charge Points in the UK. The two scrips can be used to extract the data from source and placed inside a chosen directory to be read by the dash application. 
There is also a data folder with the data used by the dashboard. The App.py needs to have the directory changed to the relevant location you store the data in.
